        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Oatmeal is never hard to make, but how you cook it will depend on what kind of oats you buy. 
        So, first and foremost, you have to know your oats. In the store, you will typically see whole oat groats,
        steel cut oats, old-fashioned oats, and quick oats.</p>

        <p>To cook your oatmeal, bring an appropriate amount of water or milk for your oat variety to a boil,
        and stir in the oats and a pinch of salt. You could also add a spice like cinnamon, cardamom, or turmeric at this stage.
        Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the porridge has thickened to your desired consistency.
        Then, load it up with your favorite toppings, and enjoy!</p>
